# MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT...
# 🧠 Machine Learning

<img src="https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=pytorch,tensorflow,sklearn,huggingface,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,opencv&titles=true&perline=3" align="left" width="40%" />

I use deep learning frameworks to build original and customized machine learning engines, including object-detection models(CNN), time-based models (RNN), and Bayesian optimization.

I am actively training Large Language Models including Qwen-3, Phi-4, and Llama-3. I primarily source datasets from Hugging Face and evaluate performance using benchmarks such as SuperGPQA, HLE, Agentbench, and StructEval.

I also train CNN-based models like YOLO. I mainly reference datasets from Roboflow and have worked on practical applications including bacterial detection in medical domains and automated danger prediction systems for kindergartens that detect adults, children, and objects.

# 🤖 AI Engineering

<img src="https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=langchain,streamlit,googleanalytics&titles=true&perline=3" align="left" width="40%" />

I utilize data analytics APIs including Google Analytics, and frameworks like LangChain, DSPy, and Mastra to build AI applications. I have created analytics systems to increase blog user acquisition and AI agents for recommending promising talent.

# 💻 Frontend

<img src="https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=typescript,react,nextjs,tanstack,playwright,storybook&titles=true&perline=3" align="left" width="40%" />

I'm interested in modern web development with TypeScript and the React ecosystem for building scalable user interfaces, including testing frameworks. This knowledge will be valuable for my goal of becoming a Project Manager.

## Also Passionate about...
## ⚙️ Backend
![Backend Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=python,fastapi,django,djangorestframework,golang,gin,rust,swagger&titles=true&perline=10)

I'm interested in modern backend development with Go, Rust, and Python. Recently, I'm studying architectural strategies to make application readable (especially for Python projects) and maintainable.

## 🐳 Container/Infra
![Container/Infra Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=docker,githubactions,aws,azure,gcp,ngrok&titles=true&perline=10)

To become a strong engineer, I believe I must study how to operate and scale applications and ML models. This conviction comes from my past development experience.

## 🗄️ Data
![Data Skills](https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=postgresql,mysql,dynamodb,celery,s3&titles=true&perline=10)

As long as data is properly organized, you can create reasonably good models even with suboptimal approaches. I believe that handling massive datasets is unavoidable for creating better models.
